- 👋 Hi, I’m @Manahil-23
- 👀 I’m interested in **the intersection of physics, coding, and communication**. I aim to build simulations and mechanics-based projects inspired by real-world research — especially those aligned with **CERN-level physics**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **computational physics**, **Python & C++ for scientific simulations**, and **how to visualize mechanics and particle interactions**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **physics demonstration tools**, **outreach-oriented science projects**, and exciting upcoming work with my partner in science — together known as **Phys.Duo**.
- 📫 How to reach me: **manahilfarid8@gmail.com**
- 😄 Pronouns: Qalb-i-Quantum 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a published poetess and a passionate science tutor, blending creativity with education.

🧠 “My dream is to build code that moves like nature — from Newton to CERN, one simulation at a time.”
